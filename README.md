class name: AdminPlus_v4.AdminPlus4Mut (actually not v4)
This mutator is based on AdminPlus_v3, thanks to Rythmix, RED-FROG,mkhaos7, and James M. Poore Jr.
And I added some new features to have admin fully control this game at any time - its difficulty and players. It's a bit like an extra simplified kf2's controlled difficulty mutator, which means you can modify zeds' and waves' several properties.
Here is the features list. You can print these on console by typing Admin Help after logging in.
